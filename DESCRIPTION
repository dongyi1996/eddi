Description: The eddi package allows users to easily acquire and work with the 
  National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Evaporative Demand 
  Drought Index (EDDI) data product, which is useful for detecting drought at 
  multiple time scales, from weekly "flash droughts" to month-spanning 
  long-term droughts. This package finds and downloads raw EDDI data, 
  then reads the data into R using the raster package. More information about
  the EDDI data product can be found at <https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/eddi/>.
