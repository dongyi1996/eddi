Description: Acquire and work with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric 
  Administration Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) data product, which 
  detects drought at multiple time scales, from weekly "flash droughts" to 
  long-term droughts. This package finds and downloads raw EDDI data, 
  then reads the data into R using the raster package. More information about
  the EDDI data product can be found at <https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/eddi/>.
